# freectl

Lightning-fast command-line tool and web UI for finding cool stuff in Git repositories.

**This tool is still in active development and should definitely not be exposed on the public internet.**

## Features

- üîç Fuzzy search through cached Git repositories
- üì¶ Cache and update Git repositories locally
- üìä Generate statistics about repository content
- üåê Web interface for searching
- üé® Beautiful TUI interface
- üîÑ Automatic repository updates
- üåì Toggleable dark theme
- üê≥ Docker support

## What does this _actually do?_

(Again, `freectl` is in active development. There **are** glaring bugs.)

`freectl` is a handy tool for downloading Git repositories containing a lot of URLs (typically in the form of markdown lists, like awesome-lists) and making them searchable.

It uses a very scrappy, home-grown markdown parser to extract URLs, titles/descriptions, and categories by looking for common patterns in markdown lists. This happens _while_ searching, so there is no indexing process - repositories are fuzzy-searched directly with a configurable query delay. This might not scale well if you add too many repositories!

There is also a basic favouriting system. Favourites and settings are stored locally as JSON files in `~/.config/freectl/`.

The "Stats" page is very broken right now, and to be honest is low down on the list of priorities for this project.

The frontend is (in theory) embedded into the Go binary, so it should be pretty portable.

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Igglybuff/freectl.git
cd freectl
go build
chmod +x freectl
mv freectl ~/.local/bin/freectl
```

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/Igglybuff/freectl@latest
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t freectl .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name freectl \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/.local/cache/freectl:/root/.local/cache/freectl \
  -v ~/.config/freectl:/root/.config/freectl \
  freectl
```

The Docker container exposes port 8080 and mounts two volumes:
- `~/.local/cache/freectl` for repository caches
- `~/.config/freectl` for storing favorites

### Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  freectl:
    build: .
    container_name: freectl
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ~/.local/cache/freectl:/root/.local/cache/freectl
      - ~/.config/freectl:/root/.config/freectl
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:
```bash
# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the service
docker compose down
```

## Usage

### Add

```bash
# Add a Git repository
freectl add https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy --name awesome-piracy
```

### Update

```bash
# Update all cached repositories
freectl update

# Update a specific repository
freectl update --repo repository-name
```

### Search

```bash
# Search in all cached repositories
freectl search "query"

# Search in a specific repository
freectl search "query" --repo repository-name
```

### Stats

This feature is still a work in progress.

```bash
# Show stats for a specific repository
freectl stats --repo repository-name
```

### Web interface

```bash
# Start the web interface on port 8080
freectl serve --port 8080
```

The web interface is available at `http://localhost:8080` by default. You can change the port using the `--port` flag.

## Configuration

The tool uses the following default paths:
- `~/.local/cache/freectl` for repository caches
- `~/.config/freectl/config.json` for configuration

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24
- Git

### Building

```bash
go build
```
