# freectl

Lightning-fast command-line tool and web UI for finding cool stuff from various data sources.

**This tool is still in active development and should definitely not be exposed on the public internet.**

## Features

- üîç Fuzzy search through cached data sources
- üì¶ Cache and update data sources locally
- üìä Generate statistics about cached content
- üåê Web interface for searching
- üé® Beautiful TUI interface
- üîÑ Automatic source updates
- üåì Toggleable dark theme
- üê≥ Docker support

## What does this _actually do?_

(Again, `freectl` is in active development. There **are** glaring bugs.)

`freectl` is a handy tool for downloading data sources containing a lot of URLs (like "awesome" lists) and making them searchable.

It uses a very scrappy, semi-home-grown markdown link parser to extract URLs, titles/descriptions, and categories by looking for common patterns in markdown lists. This happens _while_ searching, so there is no indexing process - data sources are fuzzy-searched directly with a configurable query delay. This might not scale well if you add too many data sources!

There is also a basic favouriting system. Favourites and settings are stored locally as JSON files in `~/.config/freectl/`.

The frontend is (in theory) embedded into the Go binary, so it should be pretty portable.

## Which data source types are supported?

1. Most Git-hosted "awesome lists" (`freectl add https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy --type git`)
2. Reddit wikis (`freectl add https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/movies_and_tv --type reddit_wiki --name "/r/Piracy Movies & TV"`)

### Handy trick

1. Add a list-of-lists like [this one](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
2. Search it for lists using the web UI
3. Click the kebab menu next to a result
4. Click "Add data source" to download it and make it searchable too :)

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Igglybuff/freectl.git
cd freectl
go build
chmod +x freectl
mv freectl ~/.local/bin/freectl
```

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/Igglybuff/freectl@latest
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t freectl .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name freectl \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/.local/cache/freectl:/root/.local/cache/freectl \
  -v ~/.config/freectl:/root/.config/freectl \
  freectl
```

The Docker container exposes port 8080 and mounts two volumes:
- `~/.local/cache/freectl` for data source caches
- `~/.config/freectl` for storing favorites

### Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  freectl:
    build: .
    container_name: freectl
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ~/.local/cache/freectl:/root/.local/cache/freectl
      - ~/.config/freectl:/root/.config/freectl
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:
```bash
# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the service
docker compose down
```

## Usage

### Add

```bash
# Add a Git repository
freectl add https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy \
  --name awesome-piracy \
  --type git

# Add a Reddit wiki
freectl add https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/movies_and_tv \
  --type reddit_wiki \
  --name "/r/Piracy Movies & TV"
```

### Update

```bash
# Update all cached data sources
freectl update
```

### Search

```bash
# Search in all cached data sources
freectl search "query"

# Search in a specific data source
freectl search "query" --source source-name
```

### Stats

This feature is still a work in progress.

```bash
# Show stats for a specific data source
freectl stats --source source-name
```

### Web interface

```bash
# Start the web interface on port 8080
freectl serve --port 8080
```

The web interface is available at `http://localhost:8080` by default. You can change the port using the `--port` flag.

## Configuration

The tool uses the following default paths:
- `~/.local/cache/freectl` for data source caches
- `~/.config/freectl/config.json` for configuration
